# -Investigate-IMDB-Movie-Dataset
## by Mohammed Barakah

In this notebook dedicated to the analysis of an IMDb dataset, I conducted data cleaning and wrangling procedures, extensively utilized visualization techniques, and endeavored to extract insights. Ultimately, the following conclusions were drawn:

A discernible correlation exists between a movie's popularity and its budget. Higher budgets tend to correspond to greater popularity.

Popularity is directly proportional to the vote count; popular movies attract a higher number of votes.

No significant correlation was observed between a movie's popularity and its release year or runtime.

Popular movies generally lead to substantial revenue generation.

A high vote average does not necessarily indicate a movie's popularity.

The majority of movies in the dataset fall into the category of being not popular.

The predominant genres among the highest-rated movies are drama, comedy, and thriller.

Despite these findings, it's important to acknowledge certain limitations. The dataset lacks information on newer movies, potentially introducing bias. Additionally, some budget entries are either missing or erroneously recorded as zero. Addressing these issues through dataset updates would significantly enhance the robustness of my analysis.
